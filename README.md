# About me
Hi, my name is Nico, I'm 25 years old and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Johannes Kepler University Linz while also working part time. At work
I am known as an allrounder, who can fix printer issues on the one hand and on the other can develop new systems that come in handy for our daily use.

I spend a lot of my free time on personal projects. I am currently trying to develop my skills in ReactJS and SpringBoot Security, while looking forward to 
publish my first "big" fullstack application.  
For me the biggest kind of satisfaction is the feeling after finishing a task that seemed to be impossible at first glance.

Things I work with on a regular basis:
- Java
- Spring Boot Rest
- Javascript
- React
- Material UI
- MySQL/MariaDB
- IntelliJ
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman

Things I have already worked with, but do not use on a regular basis:
- Spring Security (JWT)
- Spring Websocket 
- Socket.IO
- Python
- Tkinter
- Powershell
- MongoDB
- Native Android Development with Java
- Swift
- C
- Assembly
- ThreeJS
